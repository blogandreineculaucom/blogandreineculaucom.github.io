If you burn quite a lot of DVDs then you might have questioned why some DVDs are +R while some are -R. For some the answer is simple. My drive supports only DVD-R, so I&rsquo;m only buying those&hellip;

For the others&hellip; the ones with support for both, the answer is not that simple.

May I say it&rsquo;s totally shitty.

Let&rsquo;s start with standards. DVD-R is the approved version (by DVD Forum), and it was developed by Pioneer in 1997.

The DVD+R one was developed by the so called &ldquo;DVD+RW Alliance&rdquo; in 2002, yet it has not been approved by the DVD Forum.

I don&rsquo;t want to be misunderstood. There&rsquo;s is no standard version!

The &ldquo;plus&rdquo; in the DVD+R(W) is that it offers faster writing, better internal linking.

The bottom line is that DVD-R is the most compatible computer-burning DVD format, while DVD+R has some functional advantages.
