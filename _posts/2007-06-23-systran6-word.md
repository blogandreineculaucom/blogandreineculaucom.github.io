Weird enough, but in Vista, when starting Office Word, you get a couple of seconds/minutes freeze up of the application. The reason is the Systran6 addin. In Excel or Powerpoint - no problem, but in Wordâ€¦ The same happens when you want to exit Word.

In order to disable it, just run Word as Administrator, go to Office Menu - Word Options, then to Add-ins and Manage COM Add-ins and disable Systran6.
