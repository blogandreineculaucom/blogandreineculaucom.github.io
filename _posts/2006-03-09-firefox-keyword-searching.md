In Internet Explorer, or Opera you can easily use several search engines just by using a keyword in the address bar.

For example, typing "g windows xp" will search on Google, while "imdb crash" could search on IMDB.

How to do it in Firefox, though? Simply perform a search on your search engine, then bookmark that search into Quick Searches category. Go into Bookmark Manager, edit the properties of the bookmark, replace your search pattern with %s, and then choose a keyword to use in the future.

E.g.  
1. go to imdb.com  
2. perform a search for "crash"  
3. bookmark  
4. edit properties - change crash into %s, add a keyword  
5. done!
