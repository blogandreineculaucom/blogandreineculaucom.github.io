Two weeks after [I filed for service cancellation][1] and a refund, I get "Please have patience!"

> **B.K.**: Hejsan! Du talar med tekniska supporten, vad kan jag hjälpa till med?  
> **B.K.**: Vilket kundnummer / domännamn gäller detta?  
> **Andrei Neculau**: Hej Björn! Customer number: xxxxx (ScandicHosting), domain: andreineculau.com  
> **Andrei Neculau**: I have a ticket (id: OAT-yyyyyy) dated a month ago (April 2)  
> **Andrei Neculau**: The ticket is about a cancellation of service  
> **Andrei Neculau**: This is my 4th time I'm contacting you about it.  
> **Andrei Neculau**: Last time, on Friday, I was once again told: "somebody will contact you today!" yet nothing happened  
> **Andrei Neculau**: The cancellation form was both faxed and sent by email, but there was no acknowledgement of it so far, nor a money refund  
> **B.K.**: Please hold  
> **B.K.**: you will recieve a reply shortly - we will cancel the account, and you have no invoices that needs payment.  
> **B.K.**: Please ha patience and you will recieve a reply to this ticket today.

**LATER UPDATE**

And a couple of minutes later, I get this very innocent message, with no remark regarding the refund (not to mention the misspelling of my name, which so demeaning since I'm their customer):

> Dear Anderi,
> 
> The cancellation fax has been received, so I have now marked your services as cancelled. I also double checked that the dns servers have been updated correctly, and they have.
> 
> Best regards,
