Yeah, yeah&hellip; I know that you may say&hellip; what the hell is a &ldquo;trinklet&rdquo;?  
It&rsquo;s the key-ring that you hold your keys linked.

What&rsquo;s the connection with the theory of relativity?

Well, usually you give trinklets as a gift. It&rsquo;s one of those things that people use several times a day. It&rsquo;s a tricky gift&hellip; you give it in order for that someones to remind themselves of you.

Relativity comes when&hellip; you give it having so much faith that it will trigger memories, feelings, thoughts, questions, and the new owner has no such events.

It&rsquo;s a bit sad. Almost like being ignored.  
Yet, the beauty of our lives it&rsquo;s simply in the action of giving that trinklet. It&rsquo;s the expectations that kill us or give a boost to our positive thinking. Yet, somehow&hellip; it&rsquo;s not too healthy.

Relative: how can something mean so much&nbsp;for someone, and so little for someone else? It&rsquo;s simply a trinklet, for heaven&rsquo;s sake.
