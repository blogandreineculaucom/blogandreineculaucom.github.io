I've just posted this as a Facebook note

> **YES**  
> I know that email nowadays is the common thing to use. ~Everybody has an email address, and most of the times it's the only thing you need.
> 
> **BUT**  
> I really wonder when they will start putting virtual postcards computers around malls, train stations, museums and so on (business idea, people?!). Right now, it's not possible to do that.
> 
> **AND**  
> even if it was, I don't know if I want to send you a virtual postcard. I wanted and still want to send a normal postcard now and then. Or even a letter. Yes, I want to tell you in a few words how I feel, what I think and most importantly to ask you how you feel and what you think. Friends, relatives or merely pals.. doesn't matter that much. I wanted at least once to send you a small thing, yet gave up due to the missing address.
> 
> **SO**  
> **consider putting your snail mail (regular post) address on Facebook - go to your profile - click INFO tab - click EDIT THIS INFORMATION - click CONTACT INFORMATION - write your address - click the LOCKER icon next to it - set it at least to ONLY FRIENDS - SAVE**.  
> Or, if you have privacy concerns (that fans will stalk you or something), please send me a small message on Facebook, or a short email saying "This is my snail mail address, dear/annoying Andrei: ... Happy now?"
> 
> I'm putting my faith in you!  
> Lots of stamps are waiting at PresbyrÃ¥n offices around Sweden! :)
> 
> PS: I could only tag a few people in this note, but if you care to join the movement, please do :) I promise to send one postcard to each of you that shares her/his snail mail address  
> PPS: share this note with your people and bring back the small happy details that matter into our lives
> 
> **Short updates**  
> - snail mail = regular post  
> - leave a comment here if you update your Facebook contact information, so that I know who to send that postcard too :)
