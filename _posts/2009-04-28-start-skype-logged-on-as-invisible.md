Well, wait no more. Here's my solution (the only solution?!).

1.  **Download **[**this**][2]** and extract** the ZIP to %programfiles%SkypePhone
2.  **Edit skype.vbs in Notepad and write your Skype name.** It is needed because Skype retains a database for each user.
3.  **Double-click skype.vbs** and you should have Skype running and logging you as invisible (it also clears the status/moodÂ message)
4.  **Create a shortcut to skype.vbs** on your Desktop to always run Skype as invisible

*Tested with Skype 4.0 on Vista.*

Looking forward to hearing your comments & suggestions!
