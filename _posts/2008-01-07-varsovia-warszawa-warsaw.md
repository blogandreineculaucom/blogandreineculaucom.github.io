The Romanian Institute of Culture began a beautiful campaign in Warszawa (Warsaw), showing Polish corner-stones and their words about Romania and its people. This "Lost words of admiration" campaign is said to be a pilot-project which can be later put into action in Kraków, Poznań, Gdansk.

Between December 28 and January 18, the main bus lines in Warszawa will have the following quotes on posters outside the busses.
