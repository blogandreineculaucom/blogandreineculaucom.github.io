[Allianz-Țiriac][1] provides insurance policies for all sorts of stuff for Romanians, but I was interested in a health insurance for my future studies in Sweden.

I will be staying there for 2 years, and it would be nice to cut potential health costs, since they could prove to be quite high in Sweden.

I could basically get two types of insurances: one is a basic travel insurance, while the other is an insurance for people working/studying abroad.

Differences between the two, as provided by Allianz-Țiriac:

I managed to get a copy of their manual (Romanian), so you can read the full descriptions for both:
