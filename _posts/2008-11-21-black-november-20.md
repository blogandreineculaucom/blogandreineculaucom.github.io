andreineculau.com is back..

Why down?

*   Reason: Dreamhost
*   Specific Reason: Dreamhost's Databases 
    *   They never acknowledged this on their [notification site][1]. Why?
*   Reason: Caught the flu.. after all, it's breathin' Scandinavian air
*   Side Reason: [WordPress is a memory hog!!!!!!][2]

<div id="attachment_286" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px">
  <a href="http://blog.andreineculau.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_6079_.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-286" title="Midnight Commander" src="http://blog.andreineculau.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_6079_-300x225.jpg" alt="Midnight Commander" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    What do we have here?!
  </p>
</div>

In short:

*   a normal PHP-CGI process on Dreamhost's servers takes around 10 MB of memory
*   PHP-CGI WordPress process.. up to 30 MB 8O
*   [ZenPhoto][3] 10 MB
*   [Habari][4] 10 MB. I'll be darn if people won't start moving to it if WordPress doesn't fix its shit 
    *   WP loads so much stuff into $GLOBALS.. :x Give me a break!
    *   I wish WP would start to reform its code, and then have a programme like [Facebook's][5]
    *   Habari is Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!! Neat, simple, mannered with good standards..
*   For the first time Dreamhost support was more than 24h late to reply to my support ticket
*   I wasted my time with this, I had a nice mojo breakdown and ate sandwiches all day..
*   I went back to the shell and Midnight Commander
*   I had some quick UNIX bash lessons
*   I ended up installing [OpenGoo][6] (tipped by [the Rux][7])
*   I now have to apologize to Aron
*   Yes, I got the Gmail Themes also, one day behind the official roll-out, and I have the coolest theme ever: classic!
