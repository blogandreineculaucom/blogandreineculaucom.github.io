I've decided to format my main partition… reason:sluggish system.

Afterwards, I noticed that the notification area didn't hold the icons anymore. Not even with the option of "Hide inactive icons" turned off.

Solution: Open "Network Places" and on the left you should have an option saying "Hide icons for networked UPnP devices". Click it and restart.

You'd like to understand this action, right?… Huh… just a Windows bug!
