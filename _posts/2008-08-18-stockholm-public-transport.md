I was looking at [SL.se][1] for options to get a public transport card. The first thing you hear blows you away: 690 SEK for a month. All lines, I know, but.. 70€?? You could go to London for that money... 4 times back and forth!

The main options are

*   the 30 days card - 690 SEK
*   Season card, which gets you from September to December with 2670 SEK
*   Student card, which gets you from September to December with 1780 SEK



You should be able to get one of the first two, and then, after you get your student union card (or at least pay the student fee) you can show up at an SL center (there is one at T-centralen and one at Tekniska Högskolan, plus others) and get your student card - either paying the rest, either getting back the money, depending on which one you got.

The student union will need you to get registered first by your university - KTH sends an that by E-mail automatically. Only then can you go pay your student union fee at Nymble, and then get the bill/card and go to the SL center.

Otherwise, you can get a roll of 16 paper tickets, for 180 SEK. Depending on where you want to go, they will stamp 1 or 2 tickets - you need to tell the SL guy where you're going.

If you're really in a hurry, and you have a Swedish mobile phone with you, then just send an SMS to 72150, with the text "HA", and in a couple of minutes, you get a code by SMS that you show to the SL guy.

You can go [here][2] and check for yourself.
