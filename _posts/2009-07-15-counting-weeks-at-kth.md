As an international student in Sweden, the first time you see your schedule you will hit a wall. Instead of date, people around here use week numbers. "*So.. during week 25 we will.. and then week 27 will be for..*"

<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 200px">
  <a href="http://www.gate303.net/2008/02/06/current-week/"><img title="Current Week" src="http://www.gate303.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/scr_currentweek.png" alt="Current Week" width="190" height="90" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    Current Week
  </p>
</div>

In order to keep yourself on top of the situation, my suggestion is to install a Firefox extension (I'm assuming you are using [Firefox][1] already :p ). The [Current Week][2] extension was, without any surprise, developed by a Swede that goes by name of [Kristoffer Forsgren][3]. It won't do anything more or less than tell you the current week's number, and you can thus use it as a reference when checking when your report is due, or any other deadline that had no present-time reference in the mouth of the teachers.

"*Week 30?!? When is that? Ah!.. this is week 29. Next week then..*"

**UPDATE**: this is very very useful also for those that have the schedule made up by the odd-and-even-weeks system. Thanks, Mengxi ;)
