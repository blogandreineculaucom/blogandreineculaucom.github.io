You know, something amazed me during this&hellip; give away food to people in need.

It is a habit to reframe from eating meat or any othe animal-origin food before feasts. It is a religious thing.

Yet, I was stupefied to see an old lady not accepting the food we were giving her, just because there was some meat.

I think somebody that I met during the Global Education Seminar in Sinaia, Kevin from &ldquo;the Irish pubs&rsquo; country&rdquo;, put this type of situation in the right spot. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t eat meat, or I try not to, but if it is given to me, I accept it as being a gift. It&rsquo;s my pleasure to accept when it is given. It would be worse to say no.&rdquo;
