The second day is at its finish. It takes place in Sinaia, Romania.

All I can say is that adults are going for easy, silly things, because they think that children are stupid. Yet they go for complex, unclear, fuzzy and confusing words when it comes to higher levels of organisations, may them be governmental or not.

What is GEW all about? What is the North-South Centre (the organizer of this event)?

GEW means that once a year, schools get their students involved in projects that have to do with global aspects. Global in different meanings. The North-South Centre is a component of the Council of Europe. It deals with getting the Northern countries more involved in the aspects of the Southern countries. North to what? South to what?â€¦ Using this lack of clarity, they act in a wide range, focusing on partnerships for development.
