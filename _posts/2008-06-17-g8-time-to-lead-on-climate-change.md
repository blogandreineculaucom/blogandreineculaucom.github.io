> **Our climate hangs in the balance at the 2008 G8 Summit.** Rich countries need to commit now to mid term targets to cut emissions. **Scientists agree these targets are critical to avoid climate catastrophe.** Everyone is looking to Summit chair Japan for bold leadership to ensure rich nations make progress.
> 
> On Wednesday, **June 18, Avaaz along with our friends at GCAP will deliver a worldwide public outcry for strong G8 climate commitments to Japanese PM, Yasuo Fukuda.** This is our chance to urge rich country leaders for bold action on climate change. **We don't have a moment to spare - sign the petition now!**
> 
> ***[Petition to Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda and G8 leaders][1]:**</p> 
> The world can't wait for urgent action on climate change, and it is your responsibility to take the lead. We urge you to set binding targets to cut greenhouse gases by 2020, in line with what scientists say is needed to avert a climate catastrophe. Rich countries must help developing countries adapt and embrace a clean-energy future, and all must do their fair share to reduce emissions in time. Our common humanity demands nothing less. </em></blockquote>
