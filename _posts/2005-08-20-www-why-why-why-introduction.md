Firstly, I'd like to tell you Why.. Mainly because I sometimes (not always, and that feels reliefing) I get so many things in my head.. sometimes about important stuff, sometimes about the little things in our day-to-day life that seem to make the world go round..

Secondly, you must be wondering "Why?", so I'm going to give you an insight. Because just sometimes you feel like there has to be some sense inside the nonsense that you're thinking. There has to be!

Last, but not least, you probably got stuck with Why. It's not that I have so many genius-like thoughts, but what if somebody else has one, while reading my lines? Then, maybe it wasn't all in vain.

P.S. Why some things are (actually will be) in Romanian?.. Just simply because sometimes you have to swear in your native language!
