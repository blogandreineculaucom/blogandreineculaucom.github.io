Let's say that a freshly admitted student, name him a whoever Ikrom.. wants to get a bank account in Sweden, after getting his personnummer.

He goes, with his admission letter, passport, photo, personbevis for bank account, etc, etc.

He ends up at a branch and is told that they cannot give bank accounts to people without Swedish ID cards, and instruct him to go to the Police in order to get a Swedish ID card.



Now.. the one million dollar question is: **how much of an ass can you be to instruct an immigrant go get a Swedish ID card from the Police?** while you should know that the Police gives ID cards only to Swedish citizens, and most important while you know that your institution, your bank, is eligible to issue ID cards as well?
