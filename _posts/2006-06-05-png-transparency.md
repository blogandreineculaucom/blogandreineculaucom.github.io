If you haven't heard it yet, GIF is bye-gone!

Why? Simply because it supports only binary transparency, and not alpha transparency. This is supported by PNG (Portable Network Graphics).

The only thing about PNG is that the transparency is supported by Internet Explorer (before version 7) only with a "hack". You need to load the PNG through it's CSS filter. There are many options, but the two that I found worthy of calling themselves a real solution can be found at <http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bobosola/pngtestfixed.htm> (offers a JavaScript solution, by searching IMG tags and replacing as necessary for PNG images) and at <http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/pngbehavior/pngbehavior.html> (offers a CSS+Behaviour solution; I find this one better)
