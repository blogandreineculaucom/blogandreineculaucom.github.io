2nd semester of Engineering and Management of Information Systems programmeÂ  at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden) has a compulsory course entitled Project Management for Information Systems. "So what?" you'll say.

So, our (Miga, Gaia, Aron and I) engagement will be not to fake a project and its management, but to have a tangible and valuable IT product to manage and to develop.

In short, we will be doing a project of IT system integration with interaction features, developed for the mobile phone - it will make use of a social bookmarking browser called [Squace][1]. The integration part will cover notifying students of academic events (timetable), messages in academic email inboxes and forums (limited to their uni), articles from academic RSS feeds, etc. among others. The interaction part gives students the ability to comment informally on events, courses, people, public messages. The reasoning behind this approach is very simple. A recent counting, lead me to these results concerning KTH/DSV students: 5 Email addresses, 6+ services that can have different passwords, 20+ web addresses that they should access, they are expected to work with 4 management systems) ! I rest my case.

As for the mobile implementation, that is due to a closely working with Squace in the near future to come and because.. let's face it.. how many times did you end at school not knowing in which classroom you're having your next lecture? Do you really want to open up your laptop just to check a classroom?

We will try to develop this project with as many interfaces/APIs needed in order to make integration with other universities' systems as easy as possible. We see a real value in this project for many students, not just KTH/DSV students.

The deadline for this project is the very very early beggining of December 2009. Let's see what we make of these next two months :)
