Today I have found "friends" on the HP Support forums.

Others are going through [the same ordeal][1].Â  So you power up the notebook and all you get is a blank screen. Everything goes down to BIOS Upgrade, since everybody is connected to that.

I'm actually thinking of building an association: "HP Clients". It could get quite a nice prestige.
