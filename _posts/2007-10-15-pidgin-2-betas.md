If you want to check out the prerelease (MTN) builds of Pidgin you can go [here][1].

After downloading the package.. you should back up your Program FilesPidgin and also Documents and Settings{user} Application Data.pidgin .. and extract to Program FilesPidgin

This way you could enjoy the benefits of new releases, earlier then when the milestone is reached.

PS:I'm now using a version of [Pidgin][2] which incorporates MSNP v14 (e.g. support for status messages on MSN)
