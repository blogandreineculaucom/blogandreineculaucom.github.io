It's been almost 2 months since the last posting, and this past week I've taken some measures to restart the software and the brain behind the blog.

*   lots of cleaning - both inside and in front of me :)
*   WordPress updated to 2.8.1
*   Added AddToAny share buttons
*   Added Subscribe to comments by email
*   Unchecked the setting to close comments for articles older than 180, since (and I can't deny I'm proud of it) people find posts useful and would like to contribute. In the meantime lots of people have been cross-posting.. no more.

All in all, happy to see you again, readers ,)
