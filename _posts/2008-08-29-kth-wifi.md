* Side-motto: should we or should we not pay attention to the course? I'm writing this during my first course... not good! :P Don't do like me!

Simple steps:



1.  Connect to KTHOPEN
2.  Log on to your kth.se account, as instructed
3.  Go to <https://login.sys.kth.se/peap.html> and create your WiFi password
4.  Wait 5 minutes!
5.  Connect to eduroam
6.  Use you@kth.se as username and your WiFi password, no domain
7.  Save your connection, in order to automatically connect to it, when it's available.
8.  Et voil√°!

You can also [try connecting to KTHOPEN-WPA][1], by reading [a Swedish PDF][2], but it didn't work for me.

These steps are for Windows systems, but I think this step-by-step advice goes more or less the same for all systems. [Read here if not][1].
