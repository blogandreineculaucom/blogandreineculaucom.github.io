* <strike>Review</strike> Post-attitude of **[4 months, 3 weeks, 2 days][1] - Cristian Mungiu**

**So 17th of October will be "remembered" as the day when I understood.  
This is one of the few things that I wrote fully convinced that it is something to be read by others.**

I wrote a small "trilogy" and I think I captured quite well my feeling about the whole experience:

*   [**4-3-2, My/Our Roots!**][2]  
    Part ONE  
    .
*   [**4-3-2, Sacrifice!**][3]  
    Part TWO  
    ..
*   [**4-3-2, the Movie!**][4]  
    Part THREE  
    ...

Other readings:

*   on [the Official Homepage][5]
*   on [Rightwing Film Geek][6]
*   on Eastfilms.net: [Review][7] | [Interview][8]
*   on [Fipresci.org][9]
*   on [Cinematical.com][10]

**LATER EDIT**

Nicely written review on [an American actor and writer's blog][11].
