Years ago, I was an Ericsson fan. Cheaper than Nokia, and a lot more user-friendly. Then it came the era of 256 colors screens, and then Sony came as well.. and blue it all together.

So **for 5 years, I've been having a [Nokia 3510i][1]. I really didn't need anything more**, and the battery (original one) is still amazing. I'm charging the phone only once a week or so, after changing the call specs to lower quality. Brilliant! For my few calls and SMS, and for my need of an alarm clock and calendar/agenda.. 100% ok! Ohh, :P I forgot the Queen ringtone

<big>But <a href="http://blog.andreineculau.com/2008/08/tele2comviq/">a new network operator</a> "demands" a new phone, right? :)</big>



**I see 4 functions as an improvement to my needs: camera, Mp3 player + radio, GPS and WiFi**. All those needs are connected to my forecasts of living in Sweden for the next 2 years.

I'd like to have a camera for all those moments when you just want a snapshot, and you're not acting like a newly-landed visitor. The Mp3+radio would be nice to skip taking my [Creative Zen Nano Plus][2], so by all means this is not really a must (nothing is really :) ). The GPS would be neat when you stroll on Stockholm's streets or when you take a trip to a place you you've never been to. Wireless, wireless, wireless.. I foresee lots of places with free WiFi and it would be great to get access without my laptop around.

Yet... for all these there's a price to pay that I'm not really looking forward to go ahead with. [E51][3], [N78][4], [N82][5], [N95][6],... Even if I'd be a good liar to myself and go for a "deal" (monthly rate), instead of paying upfront.

So.. sticking to "less expensive" things! Definitely not cheap! Among them.. [6500][7] and **[3510][8] XpressMusic**. I guess I'll go with the later.. cheaper, almost the same baterry life, almost half the weight. No 3G and lower camera quality - don't care actually. The step forward would look something like [this][9].

**What do you think? What else is there around 150-200â‚¬?**

<big>Any other suggestions? Nokia or non-Nokia..</big>
