KTH/SU (Kista campus only?!) allows students and teachers to connect remotely to their Windows account. But I guess it takes luck or personal curiousity to find that out.

Without throwing some well-deserved complaints, this is how it goes. Install the following:

*   on Windows - Remote Desktop Connection (should be part of your Windows by default, I think)
*   on Mac OSX - [Remote Desktop Connection Client][1]
*   on Linux - [rdesktop][2]

Connect to **ts.dsv.su.se** without any credentials; it will ask for those after the connection has been established. You will use the same credentials as if you were in one of the computer rooms in the Kista campus.

Et voil√°! It's extremely useful when you are using software available on your KTH/SU account only, or if you want to have an environment that keeps you focused on school ;)
