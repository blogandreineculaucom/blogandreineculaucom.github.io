A few weeks ago, a friend of mine had the reply "I'm not everybody's shrink. They were barking at the wrong tree.." (referring to the fact that he doesn't have to hear about everybody's problems)

A few days ago, [Engadget closed down their comments][1].

A few hours ago, I read "[Conversation is essential. Listening is optional][2]".

A few minutes ago, I was thinking about paying for the right to comment, to be heard, to express yourself in a certain environment. Kind of a shrink policy - you pay, I listen.

Information got very much quantitative, but how much/less qualitative?

Until then, maybe there are ways to ease down with tweaks like [shutUp][3].

PS: funny how now some of us put a lot of energy into running away from being [distracted][4] by [everything][5].
