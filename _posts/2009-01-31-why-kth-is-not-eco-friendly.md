Reply to a student asking **why** it is necessary to hand in our assignments **both electronically and in print**:

> The paper copies is for letting us make notes when we give feedback to the students. It is not practical that the teachers spend an hour hour more for printing out all the students work.

Where: KTH/SU Department of **Information and Communication Technology**  
When: **2008**  
When??: [5 years after Adobe Acrobat introduced annotation features][1], and [so many years after Word did that][2]

*I guess we just have too much paper lying around..*  
[Gosh, it must be because of those trees that keep growing and growing at an alarming pace!][3]
