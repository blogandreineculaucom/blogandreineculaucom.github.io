Well, starting today, I'm counting the 3rd time my laptop is in service.

Unbelievable, but true. No AC power!

I'm starting to seriously doubt HP, or at least the nx9\*** series. Had 4 service events in 3 months. That's surreal for a 1 year "new" laptop.

Seriously talking the guys wanted to tell me that warranty is out, but since I had it in service for almost 1 month, the warranty extends with 1 month.

I also don't know about their replacing policy, because I'm in the mood to change the entire laptop. I don't want a notebook in dispair, without warranty and repair it over and over again.

Would you?
