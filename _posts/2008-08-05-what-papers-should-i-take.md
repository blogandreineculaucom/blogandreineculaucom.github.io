It's been a hard day today with all the ongoing preparations for the move to Sweden.

But one big question that is shared by most, if not every fresh Master student is "**What papers should I take?**"

Here's my list, as an EU citizen:



*   **Ticket** - booking and Passport/ID
*   **Insurance** - EHIC and private travel insurance
*   **Proof of Funds**
*   **Admission Letter** - from VHS and from KTH
*   **KTH Housing** - Proof of allocated address
*   KTH Housing - Proof of deposit payment
*   **Bachelor Diploma** - original and legalized copy (+translations)
*   **Bachelor** Transcript of **Records** - original and legalized copy (+translations)
*   **Erasmus** Transcript of **Records** - original and legalized copy (+translations)

Plus some "**good to have**":

*   **Baccalaureate Diploma** - legalized copy
*   **High School** Transcript of **Records** - legalized copy
*   KTH checklist, guides, handbook, etc

And then there are things that are highly under the category "**who knows!?**":

*   Birth certificate - photocopy
*   ID - photocopy
*   Passport - photocopy
*   studera.nu backup application (duplicates of all the papers required)
*   English certificates - original and legalized copy
*   Reference letters
