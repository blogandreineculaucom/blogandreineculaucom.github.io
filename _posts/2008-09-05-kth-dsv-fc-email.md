Ok.. things tend to get messy at DSV/ICT/IT University/KTH+SU/or whatever else you want to call it.

:shock: **So I got one kth.se , one dsv.su.se, one fc.dsv.su.se email account.**

This is my setup currently. Follow, if you think it's in your interest.

*   **FirstClass** can be setup to redirect your messages - just go to preferences  
    My setup: forward to dsv.su.se
*   **DSV** is POP3 enabled, therefore you can setup your Gmail to import messages  
    My setup: Gmail imports through POP3 from DSV
*   **KTH** doesn't have POP3 enabled, nor forwarding at the moment, but you can [email][1] them and ask for forwarding  
    My setup: KTH forwards to Gmail
*   **Gmail**: everything from kth.se , dsv.su.se and fc.dsv.su.se gets labeled with @kth.se

Interesting conversation with the IT people follows:



Me ->

> Hej!  
> I read online that if I require POP3 access to my kth.se e-mail account, I need to request it.  
> Is there some specific place where I need to do that, or will this e-mail do?

> Why do you want to use pop3?  
> When you download your emails you are responsible for the backup and everything.  
> So why not keep using IMAP so the emails are on the server and you don't have to worry about backup and your harddrive getting full.

> If you are getting low on space on it then we can make it larger.

> Let me know if you still want pop3.

Me ->

> Hej!  
> The main reason is that I'd like to have my KTH.se emails imported into 2 email addresses.

> I see that now forwarding is not yet available, due to the mailing system upgrade. But even when that will be available, I will probably need to stick to one forwarding address.  
> Of course there are ways to work around that situation, but since my 2 email accounts are on the Gmail platform, and that platform only allows import from POP3 accounts, it would be easier like that.
> 
> I don't understand why you make it sound like it's either IMAP, either POP3. Since we are talking about different protocols, it should still be the same mail server, I should still be able to keep copies of the emails in the Inbox folder.. and so on.

> Ok then, just please forward then my @kth.se mail to @gmail.com
