I understand why nobrainers use Twitter to say   
- I've just woke up   
- I'm brushing my bad breath away   
- Wow! No cereals?   
- Hmm.. I forgot to pee.   
- Uhhhhhhh... What a relief!   
- Taking a shower..   
....   
- Watching ...   
- Drinking ...   
....   
.... 



What is the added-value of that anyway? Not to mention that it takes time and some energy to put up your status. 

Plus.. just to be objective about things: who the f**k really cares about and gains anything from knowing about your tiny actions? Put it into context: there are 6.5 billions people out there, and you want to put more emphasis on your basic daily things than say.. social-environmental-cultural-economic stuff that affects hundreds (tens at least) to some thousands or millions? 

It's one thing to write an article about a visit to X, about a crappy service of Y, about project Z, but a line about some action or event? The article may be used as reference some time, but the status? 

you = any twitter-er out there
