One of the most "wild" days, yet one of the most rewarding ever.

How come?  
Simply because 24 people in need, living in Bucharest, got to have a warm meal.

How come?  
Simply because Ruxi and me managed to get them to destination, from my university's cafeteria.

How come?  
Simply because there were lots of money that would have been given away to the cafeteria staff, if they weren't to be spent until the end of the month.

How come?  
Simply because Cip (one of my room mates) let me spend it for him :)

Thanks to everyone involved, and may their thanks be heard up there.
