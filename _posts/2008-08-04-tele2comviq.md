Yesterday, Trevor and I were looking at mobile-communication monthly plans. We'll need a mobile phone while studying in Sweden, but while taking your own phone there is not a problem, getting the best plan the suites you... is.

<big>It's really not that easy choosing one.</big>

Fortunately, considering the prices (in 2008), only [Comviq][1] is at the low base. [Telia][2] is up high (in prices, network coverage and market share) and [Telenor][3] has basically the same network coverage as Comviq, small market share (so most of your calls will be outbound) and middle-prices between Telia and Comviq.

<big>So, basically the question is "Which Comviq plan?"</big>



Every student is hitting the *Kompis* plan in a heartbeat. But is it really the cheapest to go with?

Trevor had his try yesterday. Today I had mine ;) You can download the Excel [subscription comparison][4] and adjust it to your needs. [Here][5] you can also check the prices per minute for calls outside Sweden (to fixed and mobile lines), though my suggestion is to simply use [Skype][6] (PC2PC, free, or PC2phone, low rates).

I went with 100 minutes (50 calls of 2 minutes) and 40 SMS each month, because that's about my highest-average monthly usage, after looking at my previous bills.

Trevor and I both hit **Snackis 24** (perfect for our 2 year Master programmes) which has a flat price per call, per minute and per SMS no matter the recipient's network. *Kompis* plans on the other hand treat differently inbound and outbound communication.

My only "problem" is that *the Snackis line* doesn't have new-mobile deals. It's a fake problem actually because the new-mobile deals are actually just rates. For instance a phone that costs 1900 SEK up front can be just 1800 SEK if bought with Kompis, with 150 SEK a month.

Anyway, the result for 2 years is that.. with *Kompis* you pay ~3000 SEK, with *Kompis SMS* you pay ~4300 SEK but I practically didn't use the 3000 free "outbound" SMS per month... or with *Snackis 24* you pay 2300 SEK and I'm still left with 35 calls of 2 minutes each, during each month "for free" (included in the 99kr monthly fee).

**Anyone has a different opinion on this? Care to bring another mobile plan into discussion that looks OK for you?**

<big>Looking forward to that!</big>

PS: let's stay off the discussion about using the WAP version of MSN/Yahoo/ICQ/etc. It's strictly about getting in touch with someone without fussing around.

UPDATE 20080806

I added rates for calling abroad from Sweden, and improved the Excel comparison. Regarding the prepaid plans, well.. you can compare, but it's at least 100â‚¬ more over 2 years. And that's just my "very moderate" phone usage.
