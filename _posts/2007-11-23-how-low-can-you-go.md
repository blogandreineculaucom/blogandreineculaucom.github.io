I don't know who will actually believe me - but although I may seem geekish (I'm still far away from google-ing from PDA, and others :) ) - I'm still striving to be a normal guy. So... when I said that I won't be blogging while in Finland, I meant it! But... when you are watching somebody to get up (like.. really watching... and [actually trying to imagine where did she ended up with counting][1], since she seems to be so tired..) You get a need to do something other than that.

So, in short:

*   fixed phones 
*   washed dishes 
*   went to the 10min-away shop to buy just a bottle of coke 
*   read every stupid news on [Realitatea][2] 
    *   I have been reading so much about the referendum (even though I had in mind to even forget that I can vote this Sunday) that I think I simply won't go
*   installed [Ubuntu 7.10][3] with the help of [Wubi][4] on my HP DV6054ea, because there was no CD around 
    *   I have problems launching my Wireless card, but that's also because I cannot properly connect to Internet through a wired connection, so downloading packages, etc is an issue 
    *   It has a weird reaction to sound: on startup the sound is looped 
    *   Why? - Because I wanted to have a system which consumes as little battery as possible when I'm on a trip
*   went through a list of [10 career-killers to avoid][5] - *italics* = failed, **bold** = ok 
    *   **failing to have a life plan** - although I have a perspective on this, I think it's stupid to have a plan. When you have a job interview, and they ask you the world-wide known "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" - that has become simply a question to check if you can imagine and speak. The world is so fast nowadays that even asking "a year from now" is slightly begging for a surreal answer 
    *   **not keeping your skills current** - hmm, I'm quite ok with that, thought I have a general idea that you can lose yourself/your path if you become genuinely interested in a million things 
    *   *failing to deliver results* - I have a problem with this. Sometimes I put this secondly after "It has to be best/how I want it" and thus.. I fail to deliver results on time. 
    *   **confusing efficiency with effectiveness** - not happening 
    *   **believing that you are irreplaceable** - I do think that I'm unique, but if you take me part by part, I'm awfully replaceable. 
    *   **knowing all the answers** - I'm still curious at 23. I have to say sometime I invent the answer (based on current knowledge), but apparently I'm not the only one, so it's ok 
    *   **surrounding yourself with brown-nosers** - not happening. I can even say that I've rejected those that became like that, and .. with a bit of sorrow.. most of the people around me are quite good critics, which sometimes doesn't help when you want to hear "you can do it, you're the best I know" :D 
    *   ***forgetting to give credit to others*** - I have to pay more attention to make that clear. Sometimes I'm very much aware that someone else is better, or did a great job, and I'm in debt, or simply "bowing" in front, but I don't make it clear - I don't say it. It happens more often that I will show my gratitude or acknowledge past-credits by paying back somehow. Maybe it's something similar to the fact that I don't really get the point in hand-shaking. While it's ok to do it.. I feel it's a bit of a habit and nothing more. Imagine you would have kissing girls as a habit... I don't think you would do it indefinitely - first of all, you might find ugly girls, second of all, it will turn into nothing-special. 
    *   *self-promote* - hmm, it might be true. I'm confident in myself, with small/rare exceptions... but most probably I do not promote myself - otherwise someone would be dead-wrong when saying "if I were you, I would have bought a cool two-wheel engine a long time ago" 
    *   ***losing perspective*** - semi-happening. It depends quite often on the personal life. I can get distracted or dissapointed by the personal life, and that influences a lot the reaction in front of roadblocks 
    *   **TOTAL: ok = 6 + 0.5×2 = 7, bad = 2 + 0.5×2 = 3**
*   and I've also gone through [nine nontechie skills that hiring managers wish you had][6] 
    *   writing ability - checked (both formal and informal) 
    *   an understanding of business-process mapping and tools - checked 
    *   an aptitude for public speaking - checked (I've spoken lots of time in front of more than 100 people) 
    *   an understanding of accounting - checked 
    *   the ability to work with a team - .. if it's a good feedback relationship inside the team, I'm in :) 
    *   **TOTAL: where are you, hiring manager? your apprentice is waiting for a sign!:D**
*   going to watch Grey's Anatomy - Latest episode =&nbsp; I think this is like the motto of this post. If I ended up watching this, then.. I am definitely very close to "blow my brains" due to getting extremely <strike>bored</strike> chill
