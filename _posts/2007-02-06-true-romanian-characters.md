Some of us know, some of us don'tâ€¦ but Microsoft has neglected the true characters the Romanians and Bulgarians should use in Windows software.

Somehow (EU expansion) now there's a patch for Windows XP SP2, and Vista has implemented already the correct characters!

You can download the patch for SP2 here:
