==Socializing==  
One of the main advantages that you have is that you are among other enthusiastic people, and at some point you might need their skills.

So do socialize and meet new valuable people. Do that in real life as much as possible.

Beyond that, you can also use social networks. [http://www.facebook.com Facebook] is the most wide-spread service in Sweden. You will also have access to forums like [http://dis.dsv.su.se/Login FirstClass] or [http://www.ict.kth.se/forum KTH ICT].

===Facebook Pages===  
* [http://www.facebook.com/dsv.kth.su KTH ICT / SU DSV / Kista]  
**Kista Campus  
**Links to programmes' Facebook pages which in turn link to Facebook groups of graduates

===Facebook Groups===  
* [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2236876976 KTH]  
**I have no idea why they do not switch people towards a Facebook page. I rarely end up there, since they never send messages to the group members. You need to visit the page specifically, in order to see what's new.

** The International Student Service of THS has started to have Facebook groups. Just search for your "ISS Master year-year" group

===Mailing Lists===  
KTH has many mailing lists - public or private. Among them, you should subscribe yourself to some, in order to keep up-to-date.

*KTH Student Union

**You will be automatically added to a mailing list that this chapter had for each programme and year, so that you will be updated with events taking place in Kista or related to Kista students

==Books==

I'll start with the obvious: yes, you can find PDFs of some materials included in the course literature. But you will soon find yourself needing the hard copy. One cannot read at the extent that you are requested by KTH from a PDF (exception:you have an eBook :) ). PDFs are good for archiving, for annotation, etc. But it is tiresome to have only the soft copy to read from. You've been warned - you're big kids now and you can make your own decisions.

Books are indeed expensive, but if you find it useless after the course ends, next year you can most surely sell them to the younger students.

Some material can be borrowed from the library, but course literature is mostly marked with red - you can only loan it for a short period of time.

Also, some exams are open-book exams. That means that if you have the book, then you can take it with you and browse through it during the exam. No printed/photocopied/handwritten material is allowed though.

That being said, buy the hard copies (and sell them afterwards). The cheapest place to buy is probably the bookshop on the 5th floor, near Sal A, unless you go with online services like [http://www.bokus.com Bokus] or [http://www.adlibris.com/se Adlibris].

You can also try to find a second-hand book from http://www.kthbok.com (only in Swedish, but it's easy to follow) or you can check the ads or ask in \[https://dis.dsv.su.se/Login/FAV1-0000E13E/ FirstClass -> DSV Fritt Forum\] (DSV Free Forum)

==Files==

There are two file servers named goofy (for Windows) and oberon (for Linux). If you want to access then through the KTH Wireless networks, follow the same procedure for [[#Printing & Scanning & Copy Machine|printing wirelessly]].

If you want to access your DSV files outside DSV, you can do that through [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP SCP]. Read how at http://dsv.su.se/en/internal/comp/windows/sftp. If you are interested in your DSV Linux Terminal, read http://dsv.su.se/en/internal/comp/windows/samba (also for running a [http://dsv.su.se/en/internal/comp/web/publishing DSV personal website]).

If you want to access your KTH files outside KTH, read how at http://www.kth.se/student/support/ict/2.1299?l=en\_UK (also for running a [http://www.kth.se/student/support/ict/1.4789?l=en\_UK KTH personal website]).

http://dsv.su.se/en/internal/comp/rules/quota says that you have a disk quota on these file servers (200 Mbyte for Windows, 1000 Mbyte for Linux).

If you want to keep files synchronized automatically, may them be course resources, or project working directories, I suggest you "install" [http://forums.getdropbox.com/topic.php?id=7729 DropBox portable] on your Windows terminal (under "My Documents") and install the full version on your laptop. If needed, you can figure out where a certain software keeps its working directory on your Windows terminal (maybe on the file servers mentioned above) and you can use the feature of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS\_junction\_point NTFS junctions/symbolic link] to create a "mirror" folder inside the DropBox folder. That works also if you want to work with a partner on the same files (but not in parallel!)

==Websites==

As mentioned before, you get one web storage through KTH, and one through DSV.

One is at http://www.isk.kth.se/~username ([http://www.kth.se/student/support/ict/1.4789?l=en_UK read more]).  
The other one at http://people.dsv.su.se/~username ([http://dsv.su.se/en/internal/comp/web/ read more]).

I foresee two situations. One is when you already have a personal website on a 3rd party host, or a blog, or a Flickr collection, or whatever. The other one is when you would like to have some school projects hosted on school servers.

Either way, I suggest that you forward these two addresses to your online identity. That will aid your academic identity and your socializing activities.

My case is that they both redirect the visitor to my personal domain.

==Managing E-mails==

I have previously told you that you are basically getting 2 Email addresses with each KTH an DSV account. One problem is that you are obliged to keep yourself up-to-date with school information ("Students are expected to check their e-mail and read messages in course conferences daily." says http://dsv.su.se/en/projektx/en_kom), and that translates also to wherever you receive a school message, you should be able to read it (and reply to it) ASAP.

Two accounts are actually aliases by default. kth-id@kth.se, username@isk.kth.se and username@kth.se are one and the same thing.

"'username@kth.se"' (or kth-id@kth.se, or username@isk.kth.se)  
*Webmail: http://webmail.kth.se ; use [[KTH.ICT\_SU.DSV\_Must\_Have#KTH\_Account|KTH Account]]  
*Client settings (IMAP/SMTP): http://www.kth.se/student/support/ict/2.6340/1.21418?l=en_UK  
*Forwarding settings: https://www.kth.se/student/minasidor/installningar/mail.jsp  
*Read more: http://www.kth.se/student/support/ict/2.6340/1.21412?l=en_UK

"'username@dsv.su.se"'  
*Webmail: http://webmail.dsv.su.se/ ; use [[KTH.ICT\_SU.DSV\_Must\_Have#DSV\_Account|DSV Account]]  
*Client settings (IMAP/POP3/SMTP): http://dsv.su.se/en/internal/comp/email/servers  
*Forwarding settings: https://mail.dsv.su.se/prefs/ .  
*Read more: http://dsv.su.se/en/internal/comp/email/

"'username@fc.dsv.su.se"'  
*Email address associated with your groupware FirstClass account  
*Webmail: http://dis.dsv.su.se/Login ; use [[KTH.ICT\_SU.DSV\_Must\_Have#DSV\_Account|DSV Account]]  
*Forwarding settings: under Preferences window/page -> Messaging.

The most important thing is deciding which is your primary address and stick to it, so that others do not get confused. Not all students, nor DSV personnel are so aware (as you are now) of all these accounts, so when they give the FC address do send an Email there, and not to the DSV or KTH address, since that might be an Email that will never reach them (because they never check the other accounts).

My choice was to go for username@kth.se as a primary address, simply because it was a small but important balancing choice in a world(campus) that has its identity broken between KTH and SU. So that was my way of reminding myself that I am a KTH student.

Even so, I am forwarding my username@kth.se mail to my Gmail account. The reasoning for my choice is that I wanted to be able to take advantage of labeling, filtering, searching, document previewing and impersonation features of Gmail. For instance the last feature allows me to impersonate all 4 Email addresses, so that whenever somebody writes to me on the DSV address, I can automatically reply from username@dsv.su.se so that the other recipient doesn't get confused at all.

It is also nice to have all the Email addresses in one place (Gmail Contacts), so that whenever I write to a KTH friend, I can decide whether it's personal or school related and choose accordingly between his/her Email addresses. On the other hand, I have them all on the same account, readily to be searched by his/her name.

Gmail also fits better for me due to its Calendar integration.

If you want to read my personal story with setting up the forwarding, [http://blog.andreineculau.com/2008/09/kth-dsv-fc-email/ you can do so on my blog :)]

==Managing Schedules==

We all have our own ways to keep our agendas. Some still do it on paper, some do it in their mind, some do it through desktop/web service.

No matter which you are, you will need to be able to count week numbers, since professors won't reference specific days or weekdays, but week numbers. [http://blog.andreineculau.com/2009/07/counting-weeks-at-kth/ My solution to keep my head straight was to use a Firefox extension.] If you regularly use Google Calendar then you can try [http://sites.google.com/site/gcalweeknumbers/googlecalendarweeknumbers this solution].

Now, if you are one of those with a desktop/web calendar service, keep reading.

There isn't yet an iCal service that enabled you to link from Google/Outlook/etc Calendar to your schedule. That would have been nice because you could keep up-to-date without worries.

Despite that, you can download your schedule as an ICS file, and then import it into your calendar service. But you have no way to know that the schedule is accurate, since sometimes they do change the time/location of the course. But that happens quite rarely, and if it happens it is announced beforehand (one course before) and you also get an email notification from Daisy.

So my suggestion is that you do download the ICS file and import it into a special "KTH Schedule" Calendar, so that you can have your school events at hand.

Your course is most propably in the Kista campus, and so you can see its schedule through Daisy: https://daisy.dsv.su.se/servlet/student.schema.PersonligtSchema?table=true . Change the period range, and then click the ICS link on the top-right of the schedule.

If your course is given in the ValhallavÃ¤gen Main Campus, then you can go to http://schema.sys.kth.se/4DACTION/WebShowSearch/2/2-4?wv_type=4 , add each course of yours by clicking the plus sign, change the period range and then choose Text Format. At the bottom, you will be able to download the ICS file.

==Managing Passwords==

Please read [http://dsv.su.se/en/internal/comp/rules/password the DSV rules regarding passwords] before you go on.

DSV actually tells you to have a different password for each service. But lets face it - that's hilarious! And they want them to be strong passwords as well (with capitals, numbers, etc)

My suggestion is that you think of one good password that has around 10 characters - small letters, capitals, digits - and that you pick something that makes sense. Something that you can remember. Otherwise you will end up being in a hurry to print something, or whatever, and you will be locked out.

Use that very good password on all KTH/DSV services. Make the time in the beginning of your studies to change them all. It will save you lots of times afterwards.

Password info: [[KTH.ICT\_SU.DSV\_Must\_Have#KTH\_Account|KTH Account]], [[KTH.ICT\_SU.DSV\_Must\_Have#DSV\_Account|DSV Account]], [[KTH.ICT\_SU.DSV\_Must\_Have#VLE\_Account|VLE Account]]

I suggest you upload a photo in FirstClass and also mark to show your photo in Daisy to all the other [https://daisy.ict.kth.se/servlet/student.PersonligtStudent DSV students]. It will greatly increase the chances to socialize.
