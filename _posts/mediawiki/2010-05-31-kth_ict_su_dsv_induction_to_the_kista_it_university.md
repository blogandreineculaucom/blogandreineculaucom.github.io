==Word to READERS==

This resource is now (20090830) almost entirely written. Whatever is lacking has been marked with some hints or with links to related content, and will be rewritten at my own pace.

Any other suggestion/question from other KTH/SU/DSV students is most welcome.

"'<s>I have a kind request that you share this only among other KTH EMIS students until</s> In mid-October <s>when</s> I will kindly ask you to fill in a survey. I need to assess the impact/utility of such a resource, otherwise it's of no quality, but just quantity."'

"'In the meantime, please do try sometimes to use first the regular channels (KTH, DSV websites) to get the information that you need - and if you do not succeed only then turn to this resource :) Why? Because then you will be able to do a comparison between the two types of resources."'

==Introduction==  
"'The following set of articles is by no means official."'

In the fall of 2009, I have created them due to negativism towards information organization regarding my own induction at KTH Kista in 2008, when I got into EMIS (Engineering and Management of Information Systems).

In 2009 I have put some effort into collecting, organizing and sharing proper information that will aid the new students coming to the Kista campus or the Kista IT University, shared by the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and Stockholm University (SU).

"'As with the resources for admission to higher studies in Sweden, I believe that information organization needed and still needs a higher status. Information sharing is now ubiquitous, but one cannot expect each and every user to search and search and search and find all so different sources, when one wants to have a consistent base of information. [http://studera.nu.andreineculau.com This is the case with VHS and studera.nu that handle the admission to Swedish universities], and it is also the case with the Kista IT University: KTH students get 5 Email addresses, 6+ services that can have different passwords, 20+ web addresses that they should access, [http://blog.andreineculau.com/2009/01/kth-ict-moodle-firstclass-daisy-ladok/ they are expected to work with 4 management systems]) !"'

==Official induction==

KTH's official induction takes you (the newly arrived student) through civic and intercultural issues, while THS (KTH's student union) gives you a chance to socialize.

<s>Two</s>One large area<s>s are</s> is left uncovered:  
*day-to-day services and tools that the student needs  
*<s>social activities among Kista students</s>

The first area deals with IT systems and academic steps that students need to be acquainted with. My experience was that they were briefly mentioned during the 3 hours induction programme with the coordinator and the "shepherd" (the one-year-older student that tries to help out the newly arrived). All that had then been complemented on a high level by informal information sharing.. that is rumors - "I heard that.." or "Did you know that..?" Much of the information that is presented in the following resources is a mixture of personal experiences (driven by those rumors) and published information, information that is published in such a way that has little to do with easily finding it.

<s>The second area is left uncovered due to a lack of vision concerning the campus social life. There is a pub, which I find weirdly situated inside the Forum - yes, the same building where students have classes. And yes, if you live nearby and if you go after 21:00 to print something you will find dead-drunk people around it, which I personally don't find appropriate whatsoever. Taking it to a more positive side, recently there was an initiative of THS to bring international KTH Kista students together by organizing some team-sports events. But what about those hundreds SU Kista students, and more importantly what about the hundreds non-international (Swedish) KTH and SU students? Not to mention that team-sports events don't go hand in hand with everyone, like some girls for example.</s>

<s>The latter I leave to somebody else. While I will do my best with covering the first area and document answers to frequently asked questions, I will only try to figure out small activities with the newly arrived 2009 EMIS students.</s>

"'UPDATE 20090902"': While writing the following, I discovered that KTH Kista students are actually quite active in social activities. Only that DSV (KTH+SU) are left "unhandled". While speaking with the current Head of International Committee of the "Chapter of Information and Nano Technology", Henrik Olsson, chapter which can be thought of as a smaller Student Union inside the THS, I have discovered that they are never invited to DSV inductions to introduce themselves to the newly arrived. Add to that the fact that strictly KTH (not DSV) students "live" in a restricted area of the Forum building, and there you have a nice "faction". To be updated.

==Focus and limitation==  
As previously mentioned, this information is based on my own experience as an EMIS student. It is also based on the fact that I will take care of the induction of 2009 new EMIS students. Therefore some information may be irrelevant/inadequate to you.

Needless to say that I am a KTH student, so the SU policy might be different. I personally do not understand why it is different since both KTH and SU students are students of the IT university, using the same facilities and sharing the same course resources - or at least both should do that.

==Content==

These resources are split under 4 main categories - already available material, what a new student must have in order to secure all services, what a new student must know about the services and also what lies on each floor of the buildings.

They are easily accessible from the Table of Contents on the upper right, right under the KTH+SU logo.

I suggest starting with [[KTH.ICT SU.DSV Pre-reading|the already available material]]. The categories are ordered in a logical way, so reading them one by one, in that order, should provide you with the most beneficial strategy.

==Assessment==  
In winter 2009, I would like to put the following resources under assessment. I would like to see to what level this organized information has helped the new students to cope with day-to-day activities and how much slower/harder they think it would have been if it weren't for these resources.

I will personally have direct access only to EMIS students, so they will be most surely informed about the existence of these resources. Because I feel that the information has a high degree of usefulness, I chose not to have it private and shared only with them, but instead they are made public to all KTH and SU students coming to Kista. I mention this because otherwise the assessment results could be clearer.

Even so, I will probably have two surveys - one prepared for those that knew about these resources, and one prepared for those that had to figure out stuff on their own without them. They will choose accordingly which one is appropriate for them, on an individual basis.
