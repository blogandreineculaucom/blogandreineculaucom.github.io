# Plugins

*"'[[wikipedia:Skype|Skype]]"' Protocol plugin, thanks to "Eion Robb"  
**[http://myjobspace.co.nz/images/pidgin/ Download]  
**<strike>doesn't have Call and Send SMS options yet</strike>  
*"'[[wikipedia:Facebook|Facebook]] Chat"' "Protocol" plugin, thanks to "Eion Robb"  
**[http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-facebookchat/ Download]  
**<strike>it's a very basic/experimental thing so far, but it's still super-duper</strike>  
*"'[[wikipedia:Tlen|Tlen]]"' Protocol plugin, thanks to "Aleksander Piotrowski"  
**[http://nic.com.pl/~alek/pidgin-tlen/ Download]  
*"'Bot Sentry"' Anti-Spam/CAPTCHA plugin, thanks to "David Everly"  
**[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin-bs/ Download]  
**you can set up a question, basic (just for spams) or tricky (also for "morons"), and a correct answer; when a person not on your contact list sends you a message, they receive the question and after they answer correctly, they are put on a white list, you then see the conversation window and start chatting  
*"'Guifications"' Notification plugin, thanks to "Guifications team"  
**[http://downloads.guifications.org/plugins/Guifications2/ Download], [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/downloads Mirror]  
**it shows "parts and joins" (among others) on your screen  
**sometimes it's distracting me, so I have it set up to show only joins  
*"'Switch Spell (with EN, RO, SV, IT)"' Aspell Dictionary Switcher plugin, part of the Plugin Pack, thanks to "Guifications team"  
**[http://downloads.guifications.org/plugins/Plugin%20Pack/ Download], [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/downloads Mirror]  
**if you have multiple Aspell dictionaries, you can switch between them and save one as default for a buddy  
**you can download Aspell dictionaries from http://aspell.net/win32/ (although it's not the latest version, 0.6 builds seem not to work with Pidgin)  
**the Romanian dictionary doesn't seem to be up-to-date with all the diacritics' usage, but still  
*"'History "'(included)  
**show the last few lines of the previous chat session, when you start a new conversation  
*"'Psychic Mode"' (included)  
**shows the "buddy is typing" notification even if you don't have a open conversation  
**if you're in a hurry, you can quickly get over the "hi-hi, how are you?" part  
*"'Extended Buddy List Sort"'  
*"'Show Offline"'  
*"'Music Info"'

# Graphics

*"'Neat Protocols 0.1"', thanks to me  
**[[Image:Neat_protocols.jpg]]  
**[http://files.andreineculau.com/projects/pidgin/pidgin-neat-protocols-0.1.zip Download]  
**it's a personal collection of protocol icons, from many packs - includes [[wikipedia:Skype|Skype]], [[wikipedia:Tlen|Tlen]], [[wikipedia:Facebook|Facebook]] Chat, and a [[wikipedia:Google_Talk|Google Talk]] icon, if you want to replace the [[wikipedia:Jabber|Jabber]] one  
**just grab the ZIP and extract them to your pixmaps/pidgin/protocols/ directory. Be aware of the fact that you will overwrite older ones - make a backup, if you wish!  
*"'Original Smileys"', thanks to me  
**[[Image:Original\_Smileys\_Theme.png]]  
**[[:Original\_Smileys\_Theme\_for\_Pidgin|Download]]  
**since not everybody uses Pidgin, and since Pidgin is not a protocol, it's nice/better to see exactly what your chatter sees in terms of smileys/emoticons  
**includes graphics for [[wikipedia:Yahoo! Messenger|Yahoo!]], [[wikipedia:Windows\_Live\_Messenger|MSN/Windows Live Messenger]], [[wikipedia:Google\_Talk|Google Talk]], [[wikipedia:AOL\_Instant_Messenger|AOL Instant Messenger]], [[wikipedia:ICQ|ICQ]], [[wikipedia:Skype|Skype]], [[wikipedia:MySpaceIM|MySpaceIM]], [[wikipedia:Gadu-Gadu|Gadu-Gadu]], [[wikipedia:Tlen|Tlen]] and others  
*"'Guification Pidgin 2.0.0 Theme "v0.2""', thanks to [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1713449&group_id=92888&atid=676821 Octavian Bobocea] and me  
**[http://files.andreineculau.com/projects/pidgin/Pidgin\_2.0.0\_0.2.tgz Download]  
**very subtle, yet still showing the neat Pidgin logo, plus the status icon, the avatar, the name and the action  
**I added the protocol icon, turning it into version 0.2
