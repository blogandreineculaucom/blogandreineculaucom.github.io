*&#8221;&#8217;[[wikipedia:Skype|Skype]]&#8221;&#8217; Protocol plugin, thanks to &#8221;Eion Robb&#8221;  
**[http://myjobspace.co.nz/images/pidgin/ Download]  
**<strike>doesn&#8217;t have Call and Send SMS options yet</strike>  
*&#8221;&#8217;[[wikipedia:Facebook|Facebook]] Chat&#8221;&#8217; &#8220;Protocol&#8221; plugin, thanks to &#8221;Eion Robb&#8221;  
**[http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-facebookchat/ Download]  
**<strike>it&#8217;s a very basic/experimental thing so far, but it&#8217;s still super-duper</strike>  
*&#8221;&#8217;[[wikipedia:Tlen|Tlen]]&#8221;&#8217; Protocol plugin, thanks to &#8221;Aleksander Piotrowski&#8221;  
**[http://nic.com.pl/~alek/pidgin-tlen/ Download]  
*&#8221;&#8217;Bot Sentry&#8221;&#8217; Anti-Spam/CAPTCHA plugin, thanks to &#8221;David Everly&#8221;  
**[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin-bs/ Download]  
**you can set up a question, basic (just for spams) or tricky (also for &#8221;morons&#8221;), and a correct answer; when a person not on your contact list sends you a message, they receive the question and after they answer correctly, they are put on a white list, you then see the conversation window and start chatting  
*&#8221;&#8217;Guifications&#8221;&#8217; Notification plugin, thanks to &#8221;Guifications team&#8221;  
**[http://downloads.guifications.org/plugins/Guifications2/ Download], [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/downloads Mirror]  
**it shows &#8220;parts and joins&#8221; (among others) on your screen  
**sometimes it&#8217;s distracting me, so I have it set up to show only joins  
*&#8221;&#8217;Switch Spell (with EN, RO, SV, IT)&#8221;&#8217; Aspell Dictionary Switcher plugin, part of the Plugin Pack, thanks to &#8221;Guifications team&#8221;  
**[http://downloads.guifications.org/plugins/Plugin%20Pack/ Download], [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/downloads Mirror]  
**if you have multiple Aspell dictionaries, you can switch between them and save one as default for a buddy  
**you can download Aspell dictionaries from http://aspell.net/win32/ (although it&#8217;s not the latest version, 0.6 builds seem not to work with Pidgin)  
**the Romanian dictionary doesn&#8217;t seem to be up-to-date with all the diacritics&#8217; usage, but still  
*&#8221;&#8217;History &#8221;&#8217;(included)  
**show the last few lines of the previous chat session, when you start a new conversation  
*&#8221;&#8217;Psychic Mode&#8221;&#8217; (included)  
**shows the &#8220;buddy is typing&#8221; notification even if you don&#8217;t have a open conversation  
**if you&#8217;re in a hurry, you can quickly get over the &#8220;hi-hi, how are you?&#8221; part  
*&#8221;&#8217;Extended Buddy List Sort&#8221;&#8217;  
*&#8221;&#8217;Show Offline&#8221;&#8217;  
*&#8221;&#8217;Music Info&#8221;&#8217;

*&#8221;&#8217;Neat Protocols 0.1&#8221;&#8217;, thanks to me  
**[[Image:Neat_protocols.jpg]]  
**[http://files.andreineculau.com/projects/pidgin/pidgin-neat-protocols-0.1.zip Download]  
**it&#8217;s a personal collection of protocol icons, from many packs &#8211; includes [[wikipedia:Skype|Skype]], [[wikipedia:Tlen|Tlen]], [[wikipedia:Facebook|Facebook]] Chat, and a [[wikipedia:Google_Talk|Google Talk]] icon, if you want to replace the [[wikipedia:Jabber|Jabber]] one  
**just grab the ZIP and extract them to your pixmaps/pidgin/protocols/ directory. Be aware of the fact that you will overwrite older ones &#8211; make a backup, if you wish!  
*&#8221;&#8217;Original Smileys&#8221;&#8217;, thanks to me  
**[[Image:Original\_Smileys\_Theme.png]]  
**[[:Original\_Smileys\_Theme\_for\_Pidgin|Download]]  
**since not everybody uses Pidgin, and since Pidgin is not a protocol, it&#8217;s nice/better to see exactly what your chatter sees in terms of smileys/emoticons  
**includes graphics for [[wikipedia:Yahoo! Messenger|Yahoo!]], [[wikipedia:Windows\_Live\_Messenger|MSN/Windows Live Messenger]], [[wikipedia:Google\_Talk|Google Talk]], [[wikipedia:AOL\_Instant_Messenger|AOL Instant Messenger]], [[wikipedia:ICQ|ICQ]], [[wikipedia:Skype|Skype]], [[wikipedia:MySpaceIM|MySpaceIM]], [[wikipedia:Gadu-Gadu|Gadu-Gadu]], [[wikipedia:Tlen|Tlen]] and others  
*&#8221;&#8217;Guification Pidgin 2.0.0 Theme &#8220;v0.2&#8243;&#8221;&#8217;, thanks to [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&#038;aid=1713449&#038;group_id=92888&#038;atid=676821 Octavian Bobocea] and me  
**[http://files.andreineculau.com/projects/pidgin/Pidgin\_2.0.0\_0.2.tgz Download]  
**very subtle, yet still showing the neat Pidgin logo, plus the status icon, the avatar, the name and the action  
**I added the protocol icon, turning it into version 0.2
