In Windows XP, you noticed that there's a language bar, instead of the old icon in the notification area where you change your keyboard style.

The bar cannot be hidden by simply right-clicking on the taskbar, going to Toolbars, and unchecking "Language Bar". It will come back during the next startup.

To hide it for good, you need to **Control Panel** - **Regional and Language Options**. Click on the **Languages** tab, **Details** button, **Language Bar** button and uncheck Show **Language Bar**.

Click OK.
