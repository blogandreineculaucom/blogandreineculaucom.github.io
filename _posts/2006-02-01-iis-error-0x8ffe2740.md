If you want to start the Web Server, and the software throws a message like "Unexpected error 0x8ffe2740" then the answer is: another software application has binded localhost's port 80, or any port number that you selected for your Web Server.

The most common application that does that is Skype, which has an option to use port 80 or 443 as alternatives to the specified port. Check settings.
