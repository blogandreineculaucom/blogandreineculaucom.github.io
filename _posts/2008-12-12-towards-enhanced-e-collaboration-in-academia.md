* No time for other updates on this blog. Soon though (ETA Chrismas).

During "Research Methodology and Scientific Writing" at KTH/SU, we were supposed to come up with a research topic/problem and a paper (or a mini-thesis/conference paper) at the end of the course.

Without further details, this is what Aron Henriksson and I came up with, under the title "**Towards Enhanced E-collaboration in Academia. A Holistic Model for Development of E-collaboration Software**":

*   [Research Proposal][1]
*   [Research Paper][2]
*   [Presentation][3]
