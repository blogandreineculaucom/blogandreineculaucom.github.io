I was simply looking for a way to provide PNG transparency to images in IE, yet I bumped into something even greater.

There's a JavaScript library that provides fixes for Internet Explorer CSS parser, and more. These fixes will be incorporated in IE 7.

Just think… IE just got fixed! :) Isn't this a miracle?
