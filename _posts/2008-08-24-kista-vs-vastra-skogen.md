For a week now, I've been going to Kista to clean my rooms, and to Västra Skogen to surf the Internet and have some useful chats.

In the Kista dorms, so far I feel as if I'm living in a deserted place.. and when it's not deserted.. oh well. Let's stop here. You'll see where I'm going anyway..



In Västra Skogen, on the other hand... I've bumped into 3 nice girls so far.. and had a nice smile and words exchange, it smells as if people are actually living in here.. and usually there's a nice international atmosphere with Poles and Italians enjoying their stay here.
