Dalai Lama once said that it is good for the individual to focus on the spirit, while as a society we should focus on the matter. Spirituality is not going to fill our stomach!

Plastic, but very true!

Also,&nbsp;through violence any achievement, no matter how big it is,&nbsp;is a fake one, by having plenty of side-effects.

Through peaceful ways, any achievement, no matter how small it is, is a true one, by having no side-effects.
