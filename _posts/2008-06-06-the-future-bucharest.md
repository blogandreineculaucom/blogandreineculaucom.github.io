**Sorin Oprescu**: I'm not talking about a flying highway, sir.. I'm talking a suspended highway!

**Vasile Blaga**: [..] You want to take it over the [wiki:en:Victoria\_Palace], over [wiki:en:Teatrul\_National_Bucuresti|National Theatre Bucharest].. Where do you want to take it?

**SO**: No, sir.. Over MihÄƒileanu Street (n.r. on that street, the president had a house which was taken under suspicious conditions; that's the only and best answer he could give - no joke!)

[..]

**VB**: And you will take it over houses, like that.. or what do you do with those houses?

**SO**: No, sir, you don't understand that there are parts..

**VB**: No, I understand. Your whole programme is a joke!

**SO**: Once again, mister Blaga, I tell you that there aren't many expropriations

**VB**: .. 25 km.. from North to South (n.r. of Bucharest)

**SO**: Yes, mister Blaga..

**VB**: .. There are only tiny expropriations, piece by piece..

**SO**: Yes, mister Blaga. But nobody said that I will take it on the diameter (n.r. of the exterior circle). I will take it on the radius.

**Moderator**: You lost me there! What do you mean by diameter or radius?

**SO**: Radius means that it goes like this.. It cuts the circle

**VB**: The radius is half of the diameter, mister Oprescu..

**SO**: Yes, I will take it on.. Sir, com' on.. I won't take it on the contour.. I didn't go mad, mister Blaga..

**SO**: What? Am I going over monuments?

**VB**: Well, you don't have where to go. Whatever radius, wherever you want to go.. you will need to take down streets and buildings.

**SO**: No, this is what you think.

**VB**: Then, do you see this highway going over houses?! Do you have the right to do that?!

**SO**: No. I will take it in front of those houses. Soundproofed, full of greenery and with only 2 exists.. And you will go over this 25 km in 18 minutes. Highways like this exists in the capitals of high democracy..
