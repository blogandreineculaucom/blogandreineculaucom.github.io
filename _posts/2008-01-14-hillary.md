I really don't have a lot of information about Obama and Clinton and the whole US Presidential Ellections/Debates in 2008, but as far as the democrats go I think Hillary Clinton should get the lead in front of Barack Obama. So far, it's more of a personal feeling/assessment without pin-points.

But the big question is: aren't the Americans more ready to pick a black man over a woman?

I guess we'll just have to wait for Super Tuesday (February 5th)!
