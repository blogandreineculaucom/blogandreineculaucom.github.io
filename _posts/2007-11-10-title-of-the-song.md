Season 4 - Episode 7 - Grey's Anatomy

Who knows the song that plays when the afro-american (politically correct) gets the news that his wife didn't make it?

The lyrics go like this:

*   you're still so young,  
    but ya feel so old
*   and i think you're gonna turn soon,  
    gonna go with my moves,  
    just might lose you for good...  
    listen i can't fight your demons,  
    cuz i'd have to fight you..  
    they're so far inside you,  
    and i just can't seem to get through.  
    ain't any my business,  
    any my praise,  
    but i still had to try"

[**LATER EDIT**] Thanks to Kelly - there's an answer: Joe Purdy - San Jose

You can listen to the song at high quality [on his website][1].
