If you live in a private house, then you probably should go for [Bredbands Bolaget][1].

And if you live in [SSSB][2] dorms, you don't need to choose, since you most probably have Tele2 as your ISP by default. But **in [SB][3] dorms, you can [choose][4].**

<big>But how do you choose?</big>



I've built an [ISP comparison spreadsheet][5], just to compare them all, and talked with some Swedish friends. The conclusion heads to **Blixtvik or Tele2**. Basically, Tele2 doesn't say anything about a Public IP and it requires 3 months of notice before the end of contract, while Blixtvik has 2 public IP addresses (perfect for a shared room) and it has only a month as notice.

**Why not the others?** Because of the price (Telia), because of the notice period, or because of the "no-name brand" (maybe it's just me who has horse-glasses).

<big>Two things that I don't understand though:</big>

*   My shared room has only one datasocket, so how are we going to have 2 public IP addresses?
*   Why do we need to have a personnummer in order to have an Internet connection in the room? Why isn't their a big pipe coming to each dormitory building, that splits that to the tenants?! It would be so so much cheaper!
