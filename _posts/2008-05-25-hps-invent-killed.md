I was quite a happy owner of a HP Pavilion dv6054ea. I almost still am.

But HP's support seems to fail even the tiniest hope that I have left.

This laptop was bought on 2006-08-19 at 9.33 GMT :) Since then it was repaired in August 2007 (replaced items: motherboard) and February 2008 (replaced items: motherboard, wireless, hdd). Thank goodness I extended my warranty.

Just yesterday, the LAN card seems to have stopped functioning properly.



I can use a crossover cable to connect it to another PC, but the straight-through that I'm using to get my Internet feed doesn't excite the lights any longer. I replaced the jack, since it was old anyway.. but no luck. Plus the Internet connection works on another PC.

So.. it may be a foolish assumption, but I guess an important pin stopped working, thus leaving the crossover working, but rendering the straight-through dead.

The beauty of all this, is that my laptop cannot be repaired in Romania, since HP Romania doesn't offer support for the Pavilion series. Go figure! Maybe it's not even HP's invention! Maybe they bought the invention from Dell, or Apple! How the hell can you say you offer Global Warranty, if a whole line of products cannot be repaired under the warranty. Yes, they do have this mentioned in the warranty, but.. stop calling it global. Call it EU+US+.. Warranty. I don't know. Figure out a proper name!

Anyway.. so it was repaired once in Sweden, once in Poland. Both of the times due to lucky moments of being hosted there ,)

Now.. I guess I'll be lucky once again.. since in August I'll be moving to Sweden. But even so..

And then, this is what they call Chat Support:
