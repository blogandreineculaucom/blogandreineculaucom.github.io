Enough with positive thoughts :) Check out how my morning looked like.

1.  7:30 alarm
2.  Breakfast
3.  8:20 out the door
4.  8:34 subway on time in Kista, in order **to arrive at 8:51 at T-Centralen**
5.  **9:00 arrived** at T-Centralen (after SL decided to have the train wait in stations)
6.  9:11 saw the Stockholm-Uppsala train leave right in before my eyes, after not finding the right exit to the surface



And the second part..

1.  ***9:12 got a queue-number*** at the SJ-center in order to get a refund for a previously missed train (after buying the ticket)
2.  ***9:25 left the SJ-center***, when having still 4 people in front of me, after only other 4 got their issues resolved
3.  9:26 got a ticket for the **9:30 train** to Uppsala
4.  9:33 train arrives on the platform
5.  **9:40** train **leaves** to Uppsala

At this very second... the train stopped once again. Even though WE ARE ALREADY M\*F\* LATE!
