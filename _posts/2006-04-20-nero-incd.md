If you know what packet writing is, or you have noticed that since some time now, you can use your CDs/DVDs (especially the rewritable ones) as an extension to your hard drive, simply writing and deleting from the drive, then you might also have encountered some issues with Nero's InCD.

Upon start up, it throws an error saying that its API could not be loaded.

My only fix to this, was to remove it from the start up registry keys - you can also use "msconfig" to disable it from running at the start up, and simply run it after the system is fully loaded.

It is even better this way if you think about it. You are only loading it, when you want to, and not just every start up. Great for laptops.
